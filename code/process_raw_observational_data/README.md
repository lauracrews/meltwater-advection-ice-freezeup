## README
This directory contains code used to process the observational data from the shipboard sensors, underway CTD, Seagliders, and Wavegliders. 
It produces the data products archived at [UW ResearchWorks](http://hdl.handle.net/1773/47135) and described in the [observational data documentation](https://github.com/lauracrews/meltwaterAdvection/blob/main/docs/dataDocumentation.md).

This code is provided for reference and completeness. It is not necessary to rerun this code - instead, the processed data should be downloaded from ResearchWorks. Descriptions of the processing scripts provided in the [observational data processing documentation](https://github.com/lauracrews/meltwaterAdvection/edit/main/docs/observationalDataProcessingDocumentation.md).
