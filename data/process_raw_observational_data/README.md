Wave Glider data (SV3*.mat) and uCTD data (including a .mat data structure with indices of acceptable profiles) are uploaded to this directory. Unprocessed uCTD data are in the directory rawuCTDdata_loadedToMat.

The directory heat_budget_transects contains indicies of Seaglider or uCTD profiles used in each of the four heat budget transects.
